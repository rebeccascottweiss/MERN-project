# Gifts Fir Kids

Gifts Fir Kids is a web based giving app. It is a platform for smaller organizations, such as churches, to nominate children in their community to receive much needed supplies as well as gifts during the holiday season. Security is assured for each child's personal information, such as addresses, while still assuring that gifts and donations reach their intended recipient. Users of the app can purchase specific items from a wishlist, or they can donate money to the charity at large. 

## FEATURES
- Nominate a child for charitable gift donations
- Each nominated child appears on the homepage tree
- Child's personal information kept secure
- Donations page
- Track charitable giving statistics
